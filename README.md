# Flask_Sessions_Exercise

Constructs a basic survey containing questions that the user can answer  
(Trying to skip a question will result in a redirect to the current question)  
This version utilizes sessions and allows you to repeat the survey multiple times as a result.  
(There is no longer a need to restart the server every time you finish the survey)
